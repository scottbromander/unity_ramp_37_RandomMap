# Unity 3D - 2D RPG Random Map Generator / RPG Movement

This project is a combination of projects from over at Lynda.com. The first is 'Unity 5 2D: Random Map Generation', and the other is 'Unity 5 2D: Movement in an RPG Game'.
This is part of a continuing education challenge I am doing where I make a commit each day for 30 days. I am actually on my second month of the challenge and these courses represent areas of huge interest for me.

In the first course, I learned a ton about Auto-Tiling and a bit about BitMasking. Both new areas for me. Some concepts were review for me, such as managing two dimensional grids in a singular string or list of information.
